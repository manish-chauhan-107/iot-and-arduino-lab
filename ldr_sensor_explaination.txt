 LDR Stand for Light dependent resistor 


DEFINATION :
It is a light sensor whose resistance changes with with the amount of light falling on it. 

WORKING PRINCIPLE --
It is a light  sensor whose resistance is depende on the amount of incident . 
when light increases --> Resistance decreases
when light decreases --> Resistance increases


USE --
      |--Turning on a street light automatically at night 
      |--camera light meters 
      |--home automation 
      |--solar trackers.
